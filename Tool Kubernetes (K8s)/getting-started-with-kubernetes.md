# Getting Started Kubernetes

## Thoughts on Learning/Starting K8s & Helm
1. Kubernetes Documentation - https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/
    - The docs aren't always the most exciting to read, but they do have a lot of good overview/concepts I enjoy reading/getting deep dives into
2. Creating/Running a Small Kubernetes Project on a local cluster w/ Helm
    - Biggest help, able to test/experiment what works/doesn't work and do some experimentation (refer back to guides/docs while testing)
    - My small k8s experimentation project (forked from a existing project): https://github.com/TimetoPretend54/web-go-k8
3. Evaluating Applications on Cloud Clusters
    - This really helps with familiarizing with {Org} products/apps, and {CloudProvider} to also get familiar w/ it.
    - {CloudProvider}s often let you look at yaml files of k8s resources
